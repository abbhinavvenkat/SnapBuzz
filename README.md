"Snap Buzz" : Snap a pic & hear all the buzz about it!
Capture your most prized and precious moments and share it online with us!

SnapBuzz is a dynamic Image hosting website. It is an album based image journal. It combines some of the popular features of social networking and sharing domains such as Facebook, Instagram and Imgur. 
It was implemented using the Web2py web framework with custom CSS.

How to start off?
-- First, a user registers with us. His/Her details are stored in our databases.
-- Then, one has to login with his registered email and password.

What happens when a user logs in?
-- The user lands on his timeline page which contains the all his most recently posted images.
-- From each page, the user can navigate to his albums, all the albums on the public database and his timeline.

How does SnapBuzz work?
-- Firstly, we make an album on the "My Album" Page.
-- The Album will have a default picture which will be chosen at the time of uploading. 
-- Also, we have to choose the permissions of the album - if public or private. 
-- On clicking on an album, it takes you to the pictures inside that album.
-- Here, we can upload more photos.
-- Also, we can give multiple tags to the album. This can be viewed on the public album page(if the album is set to public preference) under respective tags.   
-- On clicking on an image inside an album, we can view that image. Comments can also be added by various users.
-- We can also traverse through the album from here.
-- Any user can comment on any other user's images.
